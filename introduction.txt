Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Ephraim Yeboah. A senior high school graduate from Ghana, with a vision and passion towards tech, enrolled in an online Course. This is to help better my knowledge and understanding before being enrolled. I love to learn new things, although I am a bit lazy. However, I trust that with persistence and hard work, I can achieve things even higher than the sky. I am eligible for all success. I always tell myself to help kill the sense of being left out or losing.
